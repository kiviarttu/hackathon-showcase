# IIASA Hackathon Showcase Repository

This repository is for showcasing knowledge on Python, R and bash scripting languages and present course certificates related to machine learning and satellite data usage in research. 

## EODIE

In addition to my own scripts, I would like to showcase EODIE toolkit developed at the Finnish Geospatial Research Institute (FGI). While EODIE is not a project of mine, I have significant contributions to its development especially related to parallel processing. EODIE is an open source software and can be found from [FGI GitLab](https://gitlab.com/fgi_nls/public/EODIE).
