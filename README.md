# IIASA Hackathon Showcase Repository

This repository is for showcasing knowledge on Python, R and bash scripting languages and present course certificates related to machine learning and satellite data usage in research. 

## Projects

Most of the example codes here were used in the project ["Advanced spatial data on agricultural peat soils in Finland"](https://www.luke.fi/en/projects/maatu-01). [A project report (in Finnish)](https://jukuri.luke.fi/handle/10024/554258) has been released, and a scientific publication is being prepared for submission. My role in the project was to prepare satellite data into country-wide mosaics to be used as explanatory variables in machine learning models. In addition, I was responsible for organising all the data used in the project in an organized way and fixing some minor issues with datasets from other sources. 

## EODIE

In addition to my own scripts, I would like to showcase EODIE toolkit developed at the Finnish Geospatial Research Institute (FGI). While EODIE is not a project of mine, I have significant contributions to its development especially related to parallel processing. EODIE is an open source software and can be found from [FGI GitLab](https://gitlab.com/fgi_nls/public/EODIE). EODIE has been used in several projects related to agriculture and forestry - examples can be seen in the presentation uploaded into certificates directory.
