'''
A Python script for calculating remote sensing indices that are available on 10 m resolution. 
The script will be utilized in MaaTu project for calculating indices not provided from SYKE or FMI or to do calculations from 
different timeframe.

The script is originally built to be used after running mosaic_tile_loop.sh for the relevant tiles.

Author: Arttu KivimÃ¤ki (some index formulas from EODIE code by Samantha Wittke and Petteri Lehti [https://gitlab.com/fgi_nls/public/EODIE/-/blob/main/src/eodie/index.py])
